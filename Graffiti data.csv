It is an extreme example. I don't know if the city graffiti busters (I was referred to you by Mayor Kruzan) have used black paint to ""address"" this site, but if so it actually looks much worse. The older train track underpasses all over the perimeter of the city need to be checked and the graffiti addressed. Former Mayor Tomilea Allison's policy was to paint over all the graffiti at a site like an underpass with gray paint to completely remove any trace of tagging and defacement. She did this as soon as it was reported. This discouraged the vandals knowing that no one would see their dog-like marking of that territory.","691-695 West 11th Street, Bloomington, IN"
